	3) A dashboard with the corresponding visualziations of the previous pivot tables to get capture the measured 	KPIs.

To get a better understanding of the sales and service departments, a dashboard was generated using IBM cognos Analytics and then exported as a PDF file.
The first page of this file contains four captured metrics : profit, quantity sold, quantity sold by model and the average quantity sold, along with a visualization that shows the profit by dealer.
The second page shows the Service tab, and contains the following four captured metrics on the dashboard :
	- Number of recalls per model.
	- Quantity of cars sold compared to number of recalls.
	- Customer sentiment comparison of positive, neutral, and negative reviews.
